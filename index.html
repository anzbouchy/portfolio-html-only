        Consumer Operations Analyst – Cazoo Jan 2023- Aug 2023
        <ul>
          <li>
            Utilised workflow builders to integrate Slack and Google Sheets, to
            create an automated message generator which broadcasts data into a
            slack group when criteria are met on a Google Sheet
          </li>

          <li>
            Created an automated Journey Tracker to track vehicles that have
            been deemed not fit for the website, so would have to go auction.
            Prior to this, vehicles rejected would often be idle at several
            stages before they reached auction which meant they depreciated
            greatly. This has greatly lessened that.
